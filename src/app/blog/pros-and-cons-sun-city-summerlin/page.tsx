                        No state income tax means your retirement dollars stretch further. If you're coming from California, which has one of the highest state income tax rates in the country, moving to Nevada can put thousands of dollars back in your pocket each year.

                        Most homes are 25-35 years old. That means older HVAC systems, original roofing on some homes, and potentially dated interiors. You'll likely want to budget for updates, especially if you're buying a home that hasn't been renovated recently.

                        However, many homes have been beautifully updated by previous owners. The key is working with an agent who knows which homes have been well-maintained and which need work. I always recommend a thorough home inspection to identify any issues before you buy.

                        Yes, Sun City Summerlin is very safe. The community is guard-gated with 24/7 security at all entrances.

                        The main considerations are: (1) Homes are older (built 1989-2002), so you may need to budget for updates; (2) The elevated location brings wind, especially in spring; (3) Age restrictions mean multigenerational living isn't possible; (4) You'll need a car for most activities outside the community; (5) HOA rules govern landscaping and exterior modifications; and (6) Summers are hot (100°F+), though the elevation makes it 5-10 degrees cooler than the valley floor.
